#### **Justification of Design**
</center>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Our system implements seven Gestalt principles which are similarity, proximity, continuation, enclosure, simplicity, symmetry and closure. For the sake of demonstrating Gestalt principles, we shall just select a few interfaces.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For Similarity, we can see it on our home page following the login page. We use the same icon form and design on each screen. Then, when selecting icons, we choose icon designs that most people recognize and prefer, such as the camera and microphone icons used in our daily lives for the upload and record buttons. We can also see Proximity in the main UI. We arrange the function icons in a single column, with the profile icon at the top right of the screen. In addition, we can see the Enclosure on the animal details section of our app. We grouped the information of recorded animal into one box and separated the share button at the bottom left of the screen. In regards to simplicity, it is reflected in the minimalist design approach. The interface avoids unnecessary clutter and presents only essential elements, such as clear and concise text descriptions for each animal entry or action. Next is symmetry, where it can be seen in the animal info page where the details of animal are shown in a symmetrical pattern. Last but not least closure, this can be seen in the user profile page where it can be seen when users upload a profile picture for their account, the circular crop overlay provides closure by framing the image and completing the circular shape.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Besides that, our app has shown some principles which are from Shneidermanâ€™s 8 Golden Principles. The principles are Consistency and reduce short-term memory load, in which we are utilizing the same icons and colours in our app. For example, the camera and microphone icon is used in our app, and the users can know the icon refers to what function that provided in our app. Next, users are also able to constantly access to. The main page also only has 4 main button and one profile button at top right, as we humans are only capable of retaining 5 items in our short-term memory at one time.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Other than that, the app also offers informative feedback to the users. When the users are liking or disliking a post of an animal the like or dislike button can visibly be seen that it has been pressed. The dialogue principle also exists in our app, the user will have to press a confirm post button after trying to post an animal and then can proceed to press the button when the users are satisfied with their information on their own post.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Lastly, the users permit easy reversal of actions, in which the users can click the back arrow icon to return to previous page. For example, if users want to retake a photo or voice recording of animals, then just a click can return to the screen for retaking it. In this app, the users support the internal locus of control, which means the users are given full control of the apps without any restrictions by the designer or developer where the users are able to force quit the app if it crashes or just quit at any time while using it.
