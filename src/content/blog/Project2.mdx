**Findings from HTA1**

The given Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) for the Animal Voice Recognition app depicts user interactions and application routes. Upon opening the program, users are offered with two primary options: detect animal noises or listen to preconfigured animal sounds. For people who want to recognize animal sounds, the process comprises recording noises, examining them, and possibly recording more if necessary before returning to the home screen. Users who want to hear predefined animal sounds, on the other hand, can select from a variety of categories, including Domestic Animals, Birds, Wild Animals, and Insects. Within each category, users can travel among different animal noises using next and previous buttons, with the option of returning to the category selection or the home screen at any point. Overall, this analysis highlights the app's user-friendly design, which caters to users' diverse needs for recording and listening to animal sounds.

**Introduction**

We will be testing our application on our stakeholders which are tourists, researchers, nature enthusiasts, and students who are pursuing courses related to flora and fauna using three application: Animal Voice Recognition, Google Lens, and BookDoc. 

Each of these application have unique features to test. For the Animal Voice Recognition app, we will test its capability to recognise the species by their voice.
In Google Lens, we will test the real-time scanning feature for identifying the animal species. 
Lastly, in BookDoc, we will test the process of redeeming points and claiming rewards.

&ensp;&ensp;Brendan is a 40 year old travel enthusiast from Singapore. 
He loves travelling, especially to places that are rich in natural beauty and wildlife. 
He has a strong interest in identifying and learning about the various species he encounters while he is travelling. 
Brendan relies on his smartphone for navigation, taking photos, and other travel-related tasks.
However, he often feels frustrated because he can't accurately identify the animals and plants he sees, because many of them having small differences that look like the same. 

&ensp;&ensp;Brendan wishes for an app that can help him quickly and accurately identify species. 
He needs a user-friendly application that provides educational information about the wildlife around him. 
His curiosity on adventure drive him to constantly seek new knowledge, 
but the limitations of current apps, such as slow identification processes, make his travel experiences less enjoyable. 
A reliable app that solves these issues would greatly enhance his trips and deepen his understanding and appreciation of nature.
