**Findings from HTA1**

The given Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) for the Animal Voice Recognition app depicts user interactions and application routes. Upon opening the program, users are offered with two primary options: detect animal noises or listen to preconfigured animal sounds. For people who want to recognize animal sounds, the process comprises recording noises, examining them, and possibly recording more if necessary before returning to the home screen. Users who want to hear predefined animal sounds, on the other hand, can select from a variety of categories, including Domestic Animals, Birds, Wild Animals, and Insects. Within each category, users can travel among different animal noises using next and previous buttons, with the option of returning to the category selection or the home screen at any point. Overall, this analysis highlights the app's user-friendly design, which caters to users' diverse needs for recording and listening to animal sounds.

**Introduction**

We will be testing our application on our stakeholders which are tourists, researchers, nature enthusiasts, and students who are pursuing courses related to flora and fauna using three application: Animal Voice Recognition, Google Lens, and BookDoc. 

Each of these application have unique features to test. For the Animal Voice Recognition app, we will test its capability to recognise the species by their voice.
In Google Lens, we will test the real-time scanning feature for identifying the animal species. 
Lastly, in BookDoc, we will test the process of redeeming points and claiming rewards.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Brendan is a 40 year old travel enthusiast from Singapore. 
He loves travelling, especially to places that are rich in natural beauty and wildlife. 
He has a strong interest in identifying and learning about the various species he encounters while he is travelling. 
Brendan relies on his smartphone for navigation, taking photos, and other travel-related tasks.
However, he often feels frustrated because he can't accurately identify the animals and plants he sees, because many of them having small differences that look like the same. 

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Brendan wishes for an app that can help him quickly and accurately identify species. 
He needs a user-friendly application that provides educational information about the wildlife around him. 
His curiosity on adventure drive him to constantly seek new knowledge, 
but the limitations of current apps, such as slow identification processes, make his travel experiences less enjoyable. 
A reliable app that solves these issues would greatly enhance his trips and deepen his understanding and appreciation of nature.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dr Cheng is a dedicated and passionate 40-year-old fauna researcher from Singapore. His work involves not only researching species but also continuously updating their status to ensure accurate and up-to-date information. Despite of his expertise, he faces challenges in keeping track on the current status of the species he studies. Besides that, he also often struggles to promptly identify and record sudden changes in their populations.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dr Cheng hopes that he has an app that can not only help him to show the detailed information of species he is researching, it can also show the current status of the species in real time. At the same time, he can also update the status of the species in real time without any difficulties. This app not only can help Dr Cheng to improved his research, it can also help him to identify any current change of status for the species he is researching.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Elijah is a 20 year old student passionate about studying plants and animals. 
He spends a lot of time gathering data for projects and research. 
Elijah uses a smartphone to take photo and search online to identify species but he often finds it challenging because many species look very similar. 
It causes the data colleting process slow and frustrating.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;However, Elijah is eager to learn and improve their knowledge of nature. 
He is always looking for reliable tools to help with species identification and data collection. 
An app which is easy to user, can provide quick and accurate detailed species identification would make Elijah's studies more efficient and enjoyable.
It could also help Elijah succeed in his academic performance.

**Scenarios**

**Task 1 - Recognising the species by its voice**

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Brendan is hiking at Gunung Pulai in the morning. He is enjoying the sounds of nature around him. 
However, as he walks along a forest trail, he hears an unfamiliar bird voice and wants to know more about it. 
To feed his curiosity, he takes out his smartphone and opens the Animal Voice Recognition app. 
He taps the record button and captures the bird's voice. 
Within seconds, the app identifies the bird species and provides detailed information about it, such as its name, habitat, and interesting facts. 
Brendan feels excited and satisfied as he learns more about the bird and adds it to his list of species he has encountered.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then, Brendan continues his hike, he hears other animal voice.
He hears the rustling of leaves, which he suspects is a squirrel.
Each time he hears a new sound, he uses the app to identify and learn about these animals. 
The app could quickly identify the sounds and provides information about each species.
By the end of his hike, Brendan has identified several new species that he never discovered before during the trip. 
He feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
The Animal Voice Recognition app has made his hiking experience more educational and enjoyable.
Brendan can't wait to share his discoveries with his friends and family when he returns home.
He is looking forward to his next trip to explore more wildlife and learn about new species.



**Task 2 - Scan to identify the species of the animal in real time**

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dr Cheng is at the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, his heart pounding with anticipation to meet any species as this vast and diverse ecosystem was home to various rare species of animals. As he ventured deeper into the forest, he noticed a colourful bird perched on a low branch. Without hesitation, he raised his smartphone and use the real-time scanning app to scan the bird. Within seconds, the app identified it as a Harpy Eagle, one of the largest and most powerful raptors in the world. Excitedly, Dr Cheng recorded its precise location and behaviour, which immediately updating the global database. This instant identification and recording not only confirmed the eagle’s presence but also provided vital data for its conservation, and at the same time helping him record and update the information of the species.


&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Continuing his journey, Dr Cheng encountered a small, unfamiliar mammal was hanging on the branch above him. He scanned the creature, and the app revealed it to be a Pygmy Marmoset, the world’s smallest monkey. The real-time identification allowed Dr Cheng to document the rare sighting. The app's capabilities proved invaluable, help him to obtain crucial information about the creature, helping him on his research. With this real-time scanning app, Dr Cheng felt amazed and happy, knowing that this innovative tool was helping him to protect the Amazon’s most vulnerable species.



**Task 3 - Redeem the points and claim rewards**

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Elijah had discovered a scanning app designed to identify species instantly. Enrolled in courses focused on biodiversity conservation and with his curiosity and passion towards nature, Elijah saw the app as a game-changer in his fieldwork. With each scan of a plant or animal, the app provided exact species identification and comprehensive information, from habitat preferences to conservation status, which help him to solve the problems of identifying the species of animals and plants. While he collected data during his field trips, he also accumulated redeemable points through the app's loyalty program, which provided an opportunity to receive enhanced research tools.


&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As Elijah's knowledge and data collection grew, so did his points balance. If enough points achieved, he would be rewarded with new equipment in real life. With new equipment received, his trip to collect data of species discovered will become more excited. Through his dedication to learning and leveraging innovative technology, Elijah not only advanced his studies but also made tangible contributions to the protection of biodiversity.
