## <strong>Introduction</strong>

We will be testing our application on our stakeholders which are tourists, researchers, nature enthusiasts, and students who are pursuing courses related to flora and fauna using three application: Animal Voice Recognition, Google Lens, and BookDoc. 

Each of these application have unique features to test. For the Animal Voice Recognition app, we will test its capability to recognise the species by their voice.
In Google Lens, we will test the real-time scanning feature for identifying the animal species. 
Lastly, in BookDoc, we will test the process of redeeming points and claiming rewards.

#### **Findings from HTA1**

The given Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) for the Animal Voice Recognition app depicts user interactions and application routes. 
First off, the textual and graphical representation is the same across all target users therefore these two represents all of the different target users. 
Upon opening the program, users are offered with two primary options: detect animal noises or listen to preconfigured animal sounds. 
For people who want to recognize animal sounds, the process comprises recording noises, examining them, and possibly recording more if necessary before returning to the home screen. 
Users who want to hear predefined animal sounds, on the other hand, can select from a variety of categories, including Domestic Animals, Birds, Wild Animals, and Insects. 
Within each category, users can travel among different animal noises using next and previous buttons, with the option of returning to the category selection or the home screen at any point. 
Overall, this analysis highlights the app's user-friendly design, which caters to users' diverse needs for recording and listening to animal sounds.

## <strong>**Design Requirements**</strong>

From the existing applications that we have done researched upon, below is a list of design requirements that we will be working on for our own version of system:

**1.	Using voice recognition system to recognise the voice of fauna**
-	Users can just use the built-in voice recognition system of the app to record their voice for species identification.
-	Provide alternate pathway for users to identify the species of animal.
-	Make the process of identification of species become varies.

**2.	Real-time scanning to identify the species of the flora and fauna in real time**
-	User can just scan the flora and fauna and the app will provide its species and detailed information within second, instead of capturing its images and send to the app for identification. 
-	Can provide immediate results for identification of the species for the users.
-	Can save time for waiting the results.

**3.	Create the reward system to redeem the points and claim rewards**
-	The app will provide a balance point every time the user uses the app to identify the species of flora and fauna.
-	After enough balance point required, the rewards will be provided by letting users chooses one of the equipment from the lists for free.
-	To motivate old users to frequently use the app and attract free users to use the app.

Through usersâ€™ thought processes, we are able to clearly identify each step the users are taking to complete the designated task. From there, we can notice tiny pauses by the users when trying to do the task. This is where we can find issues of UI/UX design which are described above.
