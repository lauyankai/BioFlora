<ins>Task Analysis</ins>

**Introduction**

We will be testing our application on our stakeholders which are tourists, researchers, nature enthusiasts, and students who are pursuing courses related to flora and fauna using three application: Animal Voice Recognition, Google Lens, and BookDoc. 

Each of these application have unique features to test. For the Animal Voice Recognition app, we will test its capability to recognise the species by their voice.
In Google Lens, we will test the real-time scanning feature for identifying the animal species. 
Lastly, in BookDoc, we will test the process of redeeming points and claiming rewards.
