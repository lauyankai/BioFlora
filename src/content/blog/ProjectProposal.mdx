- **Limited Identification Accuracy in the Previous App**
The previous version of the app, which relied solely on picture recognition to identify species, often faced difficulties distinguishing between visually similar species. Many animals and plants have very subtle differences that can be hard to capture accurately in photographs, leading to misidentifications. For example, different species of birds or insects may look almost identical to the untrained eye, but have distinct calls or songs.

- **Slow and Inconvenient Identification Process**
In the previous version, users had to take a photo and upload it for species identification. This process was slow, especially in areas with poor internet connectivity, as users had to wait for the photo to upload and be processed by the server before getting results. This made real-time identification impractical and frustrating

- **Low User Engagement**
The earlier version of the app lacked a reward system, providing no incentives for users to stay engaged. Without rewards, users were less motivated to regularly track their health metrics or participate in community activities, leading to lower overall engagement.

- **Adding Offline Function to Improve Customer Service**
    - Ensuring accessibility and reliability of the app even in areas with poor internet connection.
    - Let user to access the scanning features, even though the connection of the area is low or uninterrupted.
    - Will help to reduce user frustration caused by interruption or slow internet connection while in the wild or due to network issues. 
    - Data collected offline can be stored locally and synchronized with cloud servers once connectivity is restored, ensuring data is kept for further usage.

</center>
- **Design More Interactive Interface to Attract Users**
    - Able to to attract more users to use the app by providing more enjoyable and memorable user interface.
    - Include the use of animations, gesture-based controls, and dynamic elements that respond to user actions with visual or auditory feedback.
    - Implementing modern UI/UX design principles, such as touch gestures, animated transitions, and personalized settings in order to enhance user experience for the app. 
    - These features make navigation more interesting and make complex data more accessible through visualizations like graphs and maps that respond to user interactions.

- **Implement Real-time Scanning for Instant Species Identification**
    - Users do not need to manually take a photo of the species to identify it. Instead, they can point their device's camera at the species, and the app will instantly recognise it. 
    - The solution is to implement real-time scanning using advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques. By analysing the visual characteristics of the species in real-time, the app can identify the species accurately and provide users with relevant information instantly.
    - This feature will provide users with immediate information about the species they encounter, enhancing their learning experience and enabling them to identify species more efficiently.
    - We will also regularly update the application's species data to include new species and improve the accuracy of the identification system.

- **Enhance Object Recognition with Advanced Image Processing**
    - To solve the issue of bad object recognition, we proposed to implementing a more accurate image processing system. By using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of object recognition in our application. 
    - The solution is to increase the diversity and quantity of training data to enhance the model's ability to recognise various species accurately. This will involve collecting and labeling a wide range of images to train the model effectively. 
    - Additionally, we will implement advanced image processing techniques to improve the model's performance in identifying species based on visual characteristics
    - We will also continuously improve the object recognition system based on user feeback and data collected from the app usage.

- **Introduce a Reward System for Species Data Contributor**
    - To encourage users to contribute to the species data collection, we proposed to introduce a reward system. Users who contribute accurate and reliable data to the app will be rewarded with points or other incentives.
    - The solution is to implement a reward system that incentivises users to update species data, add new species, and correct inaccurate information. Users can earn points for their contributions.
    - The contributer can be redeem rewards such as discounts, vouchers, or exclusive features in the app.
    - We will also offer the rewards based on tier system, where users can unlock more rewards by contributing more data to the app.
