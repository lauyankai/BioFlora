**1. Limited Identification Accuracy**
    - iNaturalist relied solely on image recognition to identify species. 
    - It faced difficulties distinguishing between species that look very similar because small differences in colour or shape can be hard to detect in photo. 
    - The quality of photo with poor lighting, focus or angle also affects the accuracy of the identification.
    - These problem may cause misidentifications.

**2. Slow and Inconvenient Identification Process**
    - iNaturalist current indentification process requires users to take a photo and upload it for species identification.
    - The process was slow and Inconvenient, especially in areas with poor internet connectivity.
    - The users had to wait for the photo to upload and be processed by the server before getting results.
    - This slow process may discourage users from using the app.

**3. Low User Engagement**
    - iNaturalist current features are too simple and unattractive.
    - New user are not attracted to the app, and the existing users quickly loss interest and movitivation to continue using the app.
    - Users find the app is boring and lack of interest to explore the app features.
    - The low user engagement may lead to decrease in the number of users and the quality of species data collected.

**1. Alternative Method of Species Identification**
    - We propose to introduce an animal voice recognition feature to enhance the identification accuracy of the app.
    - The solution is to implement machine learning techniques to recognise animal sounds. Users can open the app and put their device near to the animal they encounter to identify the species.
    - We will also provide users with information about the species based on the animal sound, such as their habitat, behaviour, and diet. This feature will enhance the user experience and enable users to learn more about the species they encounter.

- **Real-time Scanning for Instant Species Identification**
    - Users do not need to manually take a photo of the species to identify it. Instead, they can point their device's camera at the species, and the app will instantly recognise it. 
    - The solution is to implement real-time scanning using advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques. By analysing the visual characteristics of the species in real-time, the app can identify the species accurately and provide users with relevant information instantly.
    - This feature will provide users with immediate information about the species they encounter, enhancing their learning experience and enabling them to identify species more efficiently.
    - We will also regularly update the application's species data to include new species and improve the accuracy of the identification system.

- **Reward System for Species Data Contributor**
    - To encourage users to contribute to the species data collection, we proposed to introduce a reward system. Users who contribute accurate and reliable data to the app will be rewarded with points or other incentives.
    - The solution is to implement a reward system that incentivises users to update species data, add new species, and correct inaccurate information. Users can earn points for their contributions.
    - The contributer can be redeem rewards such as discounts, vouchers, or exclusive features in the app.
    - We will also offer the rewards based on tier system, where users can unlock more rewards by contributing more data to the app.

## <ins>**Target Users**</ins>
<p>  </p>

- **Tourists**
    - Enhance the journey experience for tourists by providing comprehensive insights into the diverse species found within the country, thus making their exploration more captivating and enriching. The app's **offline functionality** ensures that tourists can access information even in remote areas, improving their overall experience. Additionally, the **interactive interface** and **accurate object recognition** enhance user engagement, making it easier for tourists to identify and learn about various species during their travels.

- **Researchers**
    - Empower researchers to conduct more efficient and precise investigations into species populations, thereby contributing significantly to conservation efforts and advancing scientific understanding of biodiversity. The app's **immediate response feature** provides researchers with real-time data, allowing them to gather information more effectively and make timely decisions for conservation planning. Furthermore, the **reward system** incentivizes researchers to update species data, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information collected.

- **Students Pursuing Courses Related to Flora and Fauna**
    - Provide students pursuing courses related to flora and fauna with invaluable hands-on experience in data collection, fostering a deeper understanding of biodiversity and equipping them with practical skills essential for future conservation endeavors. The app's **immediate response feature** provides students with real-time data, enhancing their learning experiences and allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Furthermore, the **interactive interface** and **reward system** motivate students to actively engage in species data collection and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts.
