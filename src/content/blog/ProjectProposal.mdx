- **Service Issues:**
   - ***Technical Stability:*** 
        - The app's technical stability encompasses more than just crashes; it also involves issues like features not functioning as expected, sudden freezes, or unresponsive buttons. These issues can significantly disrupt users' workflow and overall experience with the app, leading to frustration and decreased usage over time.
   - ***Performance Lag:*** 
        - Slow loading times aren't just inconvenient; they can also impact users' ability to capture time-sensitive observations accurately. For example, if the app takes too long to load the camera function or species identification tool, users might miss the opportunity to document a rare sighting or accurately identify a species in real-time.
   - ***Data Syncing Problems:*** 
        - Data syncing issues can have serious consequences, especially for users who rely on iNaturalist to maintain accurate records of their observations. If observations fail to sync properly between the app and the server, users may lose valuable data or experience discrepancies in their observation records, leading to confusion and frustration.
   - ***Offline Functionality:*** 
        - The lack of robust offline functionality not only limits users' ability to use the app in remote areas but also undermines its reliability in situations where internet connectivity is unreliable or intermittent. Users should be able to rely on the app's offline features to continue documenting observations seamlessly, regardless of their location or network status.
   - ***Battery Drain:*** 
        - Excessive battery drain can be a significant pain point for users, particularly those who spend extended periods in the field documenting observations. If the app consumes a disproportionate amount of battery power, users may be forced to limit their usage or carry external battery packs, detracting from the overall user experience and usability of the app.

- **Interface Limitations:**
    - ***Feature Parity:*** 
        - While simplicity is a hallmark of iNaturalist's design philosophy, there's a fine line between simplicity and functionality. Users may find themselves wishing for features commonly found in other nature observation apps, such as customizable observation lists, advanced mapping tools, or more robust species filters, to enhance their experience and productivity.
    - ***Customization Options:*** 
        - Providing users with more customization options can empower them to tailor the app to their specific preferences and workflow. For example, allowing users to customize their observation lists, adjust data visualization settings, or define their notification preferences can enhance their overall experience and make the app feel more personalized and intuitive.
    - ***Accessibility Concerns:*** 
        - Ensuring that the app is accessible to users with disabilities is essential for promoting inclusivity and diversity within the iNaturalist community. Addressing accessibility concerns such as screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and navigational clarity can make the app more usable and welcoming to all users, regardless of their abilities or limitations.
    - ***Data Export Options:*** 
        - Enabling users to export their observation data in various formats and integrate it with third-party tools or platforms can enhance the utility of iNaturalist as a research and educational resource. By providing users with more flexibility and control over their data, iNaturalist can empower them to engage more deeply with their observations and contribute meaningfully to scientific research efforts.
    - ***Community Collaboration Tools:*** 
        - Enhancing community collaboration features within the app can foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among users, encouraging them to share knowledge, coordinate field surveys, and collaborate on research projects. Features such as group projects, shared observation lists, and in-app messaging can facilitate communication and collaboration within the iNaturalist community, strengthening its collective impact and relevance.
    - ***Educational Resources:*** 
        - Integrating educational resources directly within the app can enrich users' learning experience and deepen their appreciation for the natural world. Providing access to species identification guides, natural history articles, interactive learning modules, and other educational content can enhance users' understanding of the ecosystems they're observing and inspire them to engage more actively in scientific inquiry and conservation efforts.

    - Issues with object recognition often stem from multiple factors. Firstly, image quality plays a critical role, as poor resolution, blurriness, or noise can impede accurate classification. Additionally, the variability in the appearance of natural objects due to factors like age and environmental conditions presents a challenge, making it difficult for algorithms to categorize them reliably. 
    - Limited or biased training data further compounds this issue, as algorithms require extensive, diverse, and accurately labeled data for effective learning. The inherent complexity of some natural objects, such as intricate plant species or animals with complex patterns, can also challenge recognition systems. Moreover, algorithmic limitations and occasional user errors, like mislabeling during data upload, contribute to recognition inaccuracies. 
    - To mitigate these challenges, ongoing improvements in recognition algorithms, enhancement of training data quality, user education on capturing high-quality images, and the implementation of community-based validation processes are essential steps.
    - The process on iNaturalist involves users uploading an image of an organism before they can receive a species identification. This approach can pose challenges because users may not always capture high-quality images or provide sufficient context for accurate identification. Additionally, relying solely on image recognition technology may lead to misidentifications or incomplete matches, especially for rare species or those with significant variations in appearance. This "post-first, identify-later" method can result in delays or inaccuracies in species identification, highlighting the importance of providing clear images and additional information to improve accuracy.

</sub>

</center>
    - The requirement for users to post an image before identifying a species can lead to several issues. Firstly, it may discourage users from making observations if they are unsure of the species, leading to fewer contributions and potentially missing valuable data. This can particularly affect less experienced or confident users who may hesitate to share their observations without identification.
    - Additionally, posting unidentified images can sometimes result in misclassifications or errors in the dataset, especially if users attempt to guess the species based on incomplete information. This can introduce inaccuracies and reduce the overall reliability of the data, impacting scientific research and conservation efforts that rely on accurate species information. Therefore, finding a balance between encouraging user participation and ensuring data accuracy is crucial in platforms like iNaturalist.

- **Introduce a Reward System for Species Data Contributor**
    - To encourage users to contribute to the species data collection, we proposed to introduce a reward system. Users who contribute accurate and reliable data to the app will be rewarded with points or other incentives.
    - The solution is to implement a reward system that incentivises users to update species data, add new species, and correct inaccurate information. Users can earn points for their contributions.
    - The contributer can be redeem rewards such as discounts, vouchers, or exclusive features in the app.
    - We will also offer the rewards based on tier system, where users can unlock more rewards by contributing more data to the app.
