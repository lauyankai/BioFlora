## <strong>Introduction</strong>

In this project, we are going to carry out the prototyping evaluation for “BioFlora” app. “BioFlora” is a scanning app that functions to help users to identify the species of flora and fauna. The users can scan the species they found and the detailed information of the species will be shown on the screen. Other than scanning, this app also provides the sound recording feature, which provide alternate ways of identifying the species through their sound. This app was designed to help users to increase their knowledges of flora and fauna from the app. Besides that, the users can also share their findings into a community so that more people can know and learn about the species they found. Furthermore, this app can also help users to identify any endangered species so that they can provide more attention on species and will protect to prevent its extinction. 

There are three tasks There are three tasks that will be carried out by the users in this prototyping evaluation. The first task is to take a photo and record the sound of an animal, and upload. Second, the user can create a small community for species related to birds on the app. Lastly, the user can use the reward points to claim for vouchers. The target users in this prototyping evaluation are tourist, researcher and student.
