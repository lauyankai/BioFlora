### <strong>Introduction</strong>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this project, we are going to carry out the prototyping evaluation for “BioFlora” app. 
“BioFlora” is a scanning app that functions to help users to identify the species of flora and fauna. 
The users can scan the species they found and the detailed information of the species will be shown on the screen. 
Other than scanning, this app also provides the sound recording feature, which provide alternate ways of identifying the species through their sound. 
This app was designed to help users to increase their knowledges of flora and fauna from the app. 
Besides, the users can also share their findings into a community so that more people can know and learn about the species they found. 
Furthermore, this app can also help users to identify any endangered species so that they can provide more attention on species and will protect to prevent its extinction. 

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There are three tasks There are three tasks that will be carried out by the users in this prototyping evaluation. 
The first task is to take a photo and record the sound of an animal, and upload. 
Second, the user can create a small community for species related to birds on the app. 
Lastly, the user can use the reward points to claim for vouchers. 
The target users in this prototyping evaluation are tourist, researcher and student.

- Testing for Student was handled by Danish Afiq.
- Testing for Researcher was handled by Dheshieghan.
- Testing for Tourist was handled by Pravinraj.

### <strong>Briefing Notes - prepared by Lau Yan Kai</strong>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The BioFlora app is designed to identify species through innovative features like animal voice recognition and real-time scanning technology. 
Our app incentives the users, such as tourists, researchers, and students, to contribute to species data.
It helps foster environmental awareness and conservation efforts.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The app improve users' journey experiences tourists' with detailed species insights
It also offers researchers immediate data for efficient conservation efforts, while 
students can gain hands-on experience and practical skills in biodiversity conservation, 
with the interactive features and a rewarding system that encourages active participation. 
Overall, BioFlora enhances learning and engagement.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now, please do the first task, take photo and record sound of a bird and identify the species.
Next, create a community for the bird species after identifying.
Lastly, reward points to claim for vouchers.

### <strong>Observation - prepared by Danish Afiq</strong>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For the first task, User is able to immediately go to upload section to take photo. 
User is surprised to see information of species after taking the picture. 
User then clicks share and continously press confirm. 
User then immediately can find the record button to record voice of species. 
For the second task, user is able to find the community button easily. 
It took the user a moment to read through and go to the bird community. 
User did not create a community but only looked through the bird community section. 
For the third task, User was able to immediately find the reward section. 
User was able to smoothly claim the reward and redeemed it.

### <strong>Observation - prepared by Dheshieghan</strong>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Tourists like using the Animal Voice Recognition app to identify animal sounds during their trips. 
The app is mostly easy to use, but it struggles in places with bad internet. 
The reward system encourages tourists to share their recordings, and categories help them find different animal sounds. 
However, tourists want better offline features, simpler sharing, and more educational content for a better wildlife experience.
Tourists often have trouble in remote areas with bad internet. 
They find the app's need for internet frustrating. 
They like sharing easily to social media but find it hard now. 
They want to learn more about animals but feel the app lacks good information and fun facts.

### <strong>Findings - prepared by Danish Afiq</strong>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;User was confused on the community creation task, which was task 2. 
It seems that the user did not notice the button to create community as there was not an obvious button that specifically says to create a community.
The solution of the problem is to make the create community button by adding icon so that it is more obvious for the user to notice the button. 
Besides that, create guidance to guide the user on how to create community able to help user to learn the process of creating community.

### <strong>Findings - prepared by Dheshieghan</strong>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The app relies too much on internet, which makes it hard to use in places with bad service. 
Sharing recordings is also complicated. 
The app needs more interesting information about animals.
To fix these issues, the app should work better offline. 
It needs a way to download animal sounds and save recordings offline. 
Sharing should be easier, with direct links to social media. 
The app should also add more details, pictures, and quizzes about animals to make learning fun and easy for tourists.
